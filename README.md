# sms-recorder
Demonstration of how to record SMS on Android to a file and use retrofit to upload the file to a server
Uses a BootReceiver launched Android Service and a Thread with a LinkedBlockingQueue to communicate with the SMS Content Listener
Currently very "raw" and requires more commenting and a proper UI (if required)
